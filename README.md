In today’s cloud-based world, observability is no longer just about collecting logs, metrics, and traces. We can take observability to the next level with AI-powered APM (Application Performance Monitoring). Tools like Claude (cloud-based AI) and Ollama (self-hosted AI), combined with Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo, and OpenTelemetry, enable us to create an intelligent observability ecosystem. In this hands-on guide, I’ll show you step-by-step how to integrate AI with observability platforms. We’ll run with various LLM models and compare their results. The integration of AI and observability systems will enable real-time anomaly detection and faster root cause analysis for your systems. I will share with you a comprehensive overview of my experiences with integrating AI and observability systems.

Step by Step Full DevOps Project, we will create a Kubernetes Cluster with High Availability, Auto-Healing, Reliability, Auto Scaling, Monitoring, and Securing on the Amazon EKS via Terraform or Cloudformation. To do these, we will create and use GitOps Workflow(ArgoCD), Jenkins, Rancher, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), RDS MySQL Database, VPC (with both public and private subnets) for Amazon EKS, AWS Secrets Manager, Amazon Route53, Amazon Cloudfront, AWS Certificate Manager, Let's Encrypt-Cert Manager, CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana. We will do these practically, step by step.
